# MDS AppLaud : Two-Minute Tutorial 5 Part 1 

## jsOAuth and ChildBrowser : PhoneGap / Android non-PIN Twitter App

Source code from TMT5P1 for MDS AppLaud (Eclipse Plugin for PhoneGap / Android) tutorial.

The [TMT5 Part 1 Tutorial](http://www.mobiledevelopersolutions.com/home/start/twominutetutorials/tmt5p1) on [MDS AppLaud website](http://www.mobiledevelopersolutions.com/) has complete instructions, this source and useful links.

This code is html/javascript/css and therefore not specific to Android. AppLaud projects using this code run very well on an AVD (Android Virtual Device), as well as a real Android 2.x device, with carrier or wifi connectivity.

This app relies heavily on:

* [jsOAuth Library](https://github.com/bytespider/jsOAuth) - JavaScript implementation of the OAuth 1.0 protocol
* [PhoneGap ChildBrowser for Android Plugin](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/Android/ChildBrowser)
* Twitter Account, Tweets, and Registered [Twitter App](https://dev.twitter.com/)
* [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com)
* [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com)

If using the code outside AppLaud, review scripts in index.html (this version of index.html relies on AppLaud project wizard to insert scripts, etc), but as a javascript programmer, you already do that anyway, right?
